## About the Project

**Himanshu Choudhary | Personal Portfolio** is a responsive, single-page website that showcases my skills, projects, work experience, and contact information. The goal of this project is to provide a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly way for recruiters, collaborators, or anyone else to learn more about my background and technical abilities.

Key motivations for building this portfolio include:

- **Showcasing Skills & Projects.** Highlight the technologies I‚Äôm proficient in and share live demos (or links) to personal and academic projects.
- **Professional Presence.** Create a centralized, always-available ‚Äúbusiness card‚Äù that I can send to potential employers, clients, or open-source collaborators.
- **Responsive Design.** Ensure an optimal viewing experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Easy to Maintain & Extend.** Built on a modern front-end stack that allows me to add new sections or swap out content without major refactoring.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run this portfolio project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js & npm**  
   Make sure you have Node.js (v14.x or later) and npm (v6.x or later) installed. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).  
   ```bash
   node --version   # e.g., v16.13.0
   npm --version    # e.g., 8.1.0
1) git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/your-portfolio-repo.git
cd your-portfolio-repo
2) npm install
3) yarn install
4) If you have an email service or form-handler that requires API keys or environment variables (for example, REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USER_ID), create a .env file in the root directory and add your keys.

For example:

ini
Copy
Edit
REACT_APP_FORM_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/<your-form-id>
Do not commit your .env file to GitHub. Add it to .gitignore.

5) Running Locally
Start the development server

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
or, if using Yarn:

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn start
Open your browser
Navigate to http://localhost:3000. The page will reload automatically if you make edits to source files.

Building for Production
To generate a production-ready, minified build:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
or

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn build
This will create a build/ folder containing the optimized production build. You can then deploy the contents of build/ to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS Amplify, etc.).

Deployment
This project is deployed on Netlify and configured for continuous deployment. Whenever you push to the main (or specified production) branch on GitHub, Netlify automatically builds and publishes the updated site.

Connect Netlify to your GitHub repo

Log in to Netlify, click ‚ÄúNew site from Git.‚Äù

Select your GitHub account and the portfolio repository.

Specify the build command (npm run build) and the publish directory (build).

Set environment variables (if applicable)

In the Netlify dashboard, go to ‚ÄúSite settings‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúBuild & Deploy‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúEnvironment.‚Äù

Add any required environment variables (e.g., form service IDs).

Live URL

After deploying, your site is accessible at a Netlify-generated subdomain (e.g., https://loquacious-choux-cc5720.netlify.app/).

You can assign a custom domain via Netlify DNS or your domain registrar‚Äôs DNS settings.

Future Improvements
Blog Section
Integrate a lightweight Markdown-based blog (using a CMS like Contentful, Netlify CMS, or Markdown files + a static site generator).

Performance Optimizations

Implement code-splitting and lazy loading of images/components.

Add caching strategies (e.g., Service Worker for offline support).

Accessibility Enhancements

Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast checks).

Add ‚Äúskip to content‚Äù links for screen readers.

Internationalization (i18n)

Provide language toggles (e.g., English, Hindi).

Use a library like react-i18next or implement a simple JSON-based key/value approach.

Dark Mode (if not already implemented)

Store user preference in localStorage.

Dynamically toggle between light/dark CSS variables.

Unit/Integration Testing

Add tests using Jest + React Testing Library to verify that core components (Navbar, ProjectCard, ContactForm) render correctly.

Analytics & SEO

Integrate Google Analytics (or Plausible, Fathom) to track visitor metrics.

Set up robots.txt and sitemap.xml to improve search engine indexing.
